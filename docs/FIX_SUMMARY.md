# Fix Summary: Recent Failed Workflow Runs

## Investigation Results

### Failed Workflows Identified
1. **Verify Environment Variables** (workflow_id: 200954773, run_id: 18822536755)
   - Status: Failed
   - Root Cause: Environment variables not properly passed from GitHub secrets/variables

2. **notion-sync.yml** (run_id: 18797035081)
   - Status: Failed (on PR branch, not in main)
   - Note: This workflow doesn't exist in main branch, was part of a PR

### Root Cause Analysis

The `verify-env-vars.yml` workflow had a critical design flaw:
- It defined a list of required environment variables
- It checked if these variables were set in the environment
- **However**, it never actually passed these variables from GitHub's secrets/variables context to the environment
- Result: Variables were always undefined, causing the workflow to fail

### Solution Implemented

#### 1. Fixed Workflow File (`.github/workflows/verify-env-vars.yml`)

**Changes:**
- Added explicit environment variable mappings for all required variables:
  - `AGENT_ACTIONS` → `${{ vars.AGENT_ACTIONS }}`
  - `NOTION_*` database IDs → `${{ vars.NOTION_* }}`
  - `NOTION_TOKEN` → `${{ secrets.NOTION_TOKEN }}`
- Improved error messages to guide users
- Added success message when all variables are configured

**Before:**
```yaml
env:
  REQUIRED_VARS: |
    AGENT_ACTIONS
    ...
```

**After:**
```yaml
env:
  AGENT_ACTIONS: ${{ vars.AGENT_ACTIONS }}
  NOTION_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.NOTION_TOKEN }}
  # ... all other required variables mapped
  REQUIRED_VARS: |
    AGENT_ACTIONS
    ...
```

#### 2. Added Documentation (`docs/WORKFLOW_TROUBLESHOOTING.md`)

Created comprehensive guide covering:
- What the workflow does
- Required GitHub secrets and variables
- Step-by-step configuration instructions
- Common errors and solutions
- How to test the configuration

### How the Fix Works

1. The workflow now explicitly pulls each required variable from GitHub's secrets/variables
2. It maps them to environment variables within the workflow step
3. The validation script can now properly check if they have values
4. If any are missing, users get clear guidance on how to configure them

### Required Configuration

For the workflow to pass, the following must be configured in GitHub:

**Repository Variables** (Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → Variables):
- AGENT_ACTIONS
- NOTION_DISCUSSIONS_ARC_DB_ID
- NOTION_ISSUES_BACKLOG_DB_ID
- NOTION_KNOWLEDGE_FILE_DB_ID
- NOTION_PAGE_ID
- NOTION_PR_BACKLOG_DB_ID
- NOTION_PROJECT_BOARD_BACKLOG_DB_ID
- NOTION_TASK_BACKLOG_DB_ID

**Repository Secrets** (Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → Secrets):
- NOTION_TOKEN

### Validation

- ✅ YAML syntax validated
- ✅ Code review passed with no issues
- ✅ Security scan (CodeQL) passed - no vulnerabilities
- ✅ Workflow will properly detect configured vs missing variables
- ✅ Clear error messages guide users to fix configuration

### Testing Instructions

To verify the fix:
1. Configure the required secrets/variables in GitHub repository settings
2. Go to Actions → Verify Environment Variables
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Workflow should pass if all variables are configured, or provide clear error messages for missing ones

### Impact

- **Before**: Workflow always failed, no clear guidance
- **After**: Workflow properly validates configuration, provides actionable error messages
- **User Experience**: Users now know exactly what to configure and where

## Security Summary

No security vulnerabilities were introduced or discovered during this fix. The workflow properly uses GitHub's secrets management system to handle sensitive data like the NOTION_TOKEN.
