# A-05 Audit Artifacts

This directory contains audit documentation prepared for the PR-CYBR CI/CD Agent (scope A-05). It aggregates the evidence, reports, and manifests compiled during the current assessment cycle.

## Contents
- `A-05_codebase_review.md` – Detailed assessment of repository structure, dependencies, environment requirements, automation logic, and identified gaps.
- `A-05_interagent_sync_report.md` – Summary of inter-agent scopes (A-01 through A-12), coordination touchpoints, and cross-trigger data flows relevant to A-05.
- `A-05_codex_operations_report.md` – Record of the analyses performed by Codex and how the outputs align with A-05 mandates.
- `A-05_task_manifest.yml` – Machine-readable manifest of workflows, dashboards, and automation endpoints for orchestration engines.

Future audit deliverables for A-05 should be stored here to keep the historical trail intact.
