# A-05 Codex Operations Report

## Mission Alignment
The Codex audit focused on validating CI/CD readiness for scope A-05. Activities centered on cataloguing automation assets, identifying dependency gaps, and producing coordination artifacts that support inter-agent synchronization and orchestration planning.

## Analyses Performed
1. **Repository Reconnaissance** – Reviewed top-level structure, configuration samples, automation scripts, and Python sources to benchmark implementation reality against documented expectations.
2. **Workflow Inspection** – Parsed GitHub Actions (`build-test.yml`, `docker-hub-sync.yml`, `docker-hub-update.yml`, `run-n8n-workflow.yml`, and `n8n/main.yml`) to chart triggers, secret dependencies, and downstream automation behavior.
3. **Script Assessment** – Examined `scripts/local_setup.sh` and associated automation utilities to understand cross-agent provisioning logic and service integrations (Docker, n8n, nginx, git).
4. **Documentation Cross-Check** – Compared `docs/PR-CYBR-CI-CD-AGENT.md` promises against the current `src/` package to highlight implementation drift and associated operational risks.

## Assets Delivered
- `docs/audit/README.md` establishing the audit package structure.
- `docs/audit/A-05_codebase_review.md` detailing structure, dependencies, environment requirements, automation logic, and risk register.
- `docs/audit/A-05_interagent_sync_report.md` summarizing responsibilities and coordination points for scopes A-01 through A-12.
- `docs/audit/A-05_task_manifest.yml` providing a machine-readable orchestration manifest.

## Synchronization Design Considerations
- Documented how GitHub push events cascade through CI/CD, Docker, and n8n workflows, ensuring A-05 can anticipate cross-system effects.
- Highlighted the need for consolidated secret governance and artifact availability to prevent cascading failures into Infrastructure (A-09) and Testing (A-08).
- Reinforced documentation upkeep (A-12) and governance engagement (A-01) as critical feedback loops for sustaining reliable releases.

## Next-Step Recommendations
1. Populate missing build assets and align automation scripts with actual file locations.
2. Expand Python modules to implement the pipeline management capabilities referenced in system instructions, followed by comprehensive test coverage.
3. Establish a centralized secret inventory and rotation schedule with the Security agent.
4. Publish dashboard metrics covering workflow health, artifact availability, and synchronization status for stakeholders.
