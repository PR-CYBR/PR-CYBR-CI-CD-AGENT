# A-05 Interagent Synchronization Report

## Purpose
This report consolidates known responsibilities, interdependencies, cross-trigger expectations, and data flows between scopes A-01 through A-12, as derived from the shared provisioning script and agent doctrine. The objective is to contextualize how A-05 (CI/CD) must coordinate within the wider PR-CYBR ecosystem.

## Scope Summary Matrix
| Scope | Agent | Primary Charter | Key Dependencies | Typical Triggers | Data / Artifact Flows |
|-------|-------|-----------------|------------------|------------------|-----------------------|
| A-01 | PR-CYBR-MGMT-AGENT | Portfolio governance, scheduling, change authorization. | Depends on status telemetry from CI/CD, Testing, Performance agents. | Strategic cadence reviews, manual approvals. | Receives deployment reports, issues release directives. |
| A-02 | PR-CYBR-DATA-INTEGRATION-AGENT | Synchronizes datasets and ensures schema parity between agents. | Requires database schemas (A-03) and integration hooks from CI/CD to update ETL jobs. | Dataset updates, API contract changes. | Publishes refreshed data packages to dependent agents, signals schema changes to CI/CD for pipeline adjustments. |
| A-03 | PR-CYBR-DATABASE-AGENT | Manages persistence layers, backups, and data access policies. | Consumes infrastructure plans from CI/CD deployments and security policies from A-07. | Backup windows, migration requests, alerts from monitoring. | Provides connection info and migration scripts to CI/CD for rollout. |
| A-04 | PR-CYBR-BACKEND-AGENT | Implements application services and APIs. | Requires CI/CD build/test automation, integration data from A-02. | Source control pushes, API contract updates. | Supplies artifacts and API definitions to CI/CD for packaging. |
| A-05 | PR-CYBR-CI-CD-AGENT | Automates build, test, and deployment workflows. | Relies on code from A-04/A-06, tests from A-08, security gates from A-07, approvals from A-01. | Git pushes, pull requests, scheduled syncs, webhook events (n8n). | Distributes deployment artifacts, pipeline status, and incident alerts. |
| A-06 | PR-CYBR-FRONTEND-AGENT | Delivers user-facing interfaces. | Depends on backend APIs (A-04) and CI/CD packaging. | UI releases, asset pipeline updates. | Publishes web bundles to CI/CD and receives deployment confirmations. |
| A-07 | PR-CYBR-SECURITY-AGENT | Oversees security assessments, secrets management, and compliance. | Ingests pipeline metadata (A-05), infrastructure plans (A-09). | Vulnerability scan schedules, incident triggers. | Provides approval tokens and policy updates to CI/CD prior to release. |
| A-08 | PR-CYBR-TESTING-AGENT | Runs automated tests, quality gates, and regression suites. | Relies on build artifacts from CI/CD, test data from A-02. | Test plan executions, nightly regression jobs. | Returns pass/fail results to CI/CD, logs defects for MGMT. |
| A-09 | PR-CYBR-INFRASTRUCTURE-AGENT | Provisions compute, networking, and deployment targets. | Consumes deployment manifests and container images from A-05. | Infrastructure change windows, scaling events. | Supplies infrastructure endpoints to CI/CD and other agents. |
| A-10 | PR-CYBR-PERFORMANCE-AGENT | Monitors system performance and recommends optimizations. | Requires telemetry from running workloads (A-05 deployments) and data from A-02. | Load tests, monitoring thresholds. | Sends performance alerts to MGMT and CI/CD for pipeline tuning. |
| A-11 | PR-CYBR-USER-FEEDBACK-AGENT | Aggregates feedback loops from end-users and stakeholders. | Needs deployment history (A-05) and UX changes (A-06). | Feedback cycles, survey completions. | Provides prioritized change requests to MGMT and backlog inputs to dev agents. |
| A-12 | PR-CYBR-DOCUMENTATION-AGENT | Maintains knowledge base, release notes, and compliance evidence. | Depends on artifacts from all agents, especially CI/CD logs and reports. | Documentation sprints, release completions. | Publishes manuals, audit trails, and updates CI/CD onboarding materials. |

## Interdependency Highlights
- **Provisioning Script Evidence** – `scripts/local_setup.sh` enumerates cloning and setup tasks for each agent (A-01 through A-12), underscoring the expectation that A-05 can bootstrap and validate cross-agent connectivity during local or cloud preparations.
- **Pipeline Coordination** – Documentation for PR-CYBR-CI-CD-AGENT emphasizes automated testing (A-08), security checks (A-07), and infrastructure collaboration (A-09) as core functions, reinforcing the dependencies captured above.
- **Feedback Loops** – CI/CD monitoring outputs are consumed by MGMT (A-01) and Performance (A-10) agents, while Documentation (A-12) requires continuous updates from A-05 post-release.

## Cross-Trigger Expectations
- GitHub push events to `main` initiate multiple downstream automations (CI builds, Docker sync, n8n workflows), which in turn send notifications or artifacts to other agents.
- Scheduled Docker Hub syncs ensure container availability for Infrastructure (A-09) without manual intervention.
- n8n webhooks act as integration bridges, relaying repository metadata to external orchestration nodes where other agents may subscribe to event streams.

## Data Flow Observations
- Build artifacts (Docker images, Python packages) produced by A-05 feed Infrastructure deployments and Testing sandboxes.
- Logs and setup outputs generated by automation scripts form the evidence base for Documentation (A-12) and Security reviews (A-07).
- Credential usage across workflows necessitates coordination with Security (A-07) for rotation and auditing, especially given multiple Docker-related secrets.

## Risks to Synchronization
1. **Documentation Drift** – Divergence between promised modules and actual implementation can break automated expectations from dependent agents.
2. **Secret Fragmentation** – Multiple credential names for similar services complicate the Security agent’s ability to validate access flows.
3. **Orchestration Gaps** – Missing container images or failing workflows cascade into delays for Infrastructure and Testing agents that rely on timely artifacts.

## Recommended Actions for A-05
- Maintain an inter-agent contact matrix and webhook registry to ensure all triggers remain aligned with partner expectations.
- Publish pipeline health dashboards consumable by MGMT (A-01) and Documentation (A-12).
- Coordinate with Security (A-07) to consolidate secret storage and auditing for GitHub Actions, n8n, and Docker processes.
