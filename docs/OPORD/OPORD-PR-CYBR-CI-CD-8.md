# OPORD-PR-CYBR-CI-CD-8

## 1. OPERATIONAL SUMMARY
The objective of this OPORD is to update the PR-CYBR-CI-CD-AGENTâ€™s files to facilitate the loading of users into an interactive terminal program. This will be achieved through executing a setup script that utilizes TMUX to create multiple terminal windows for enhanced user interaction.

## 2. SITUATION
The PR-CYBR initiative's continuous integration and deployment processes need to be streamlined to ensure fast, reliable releases while maintaining security and compliance standards. Enhancements in CI/CD workflows will improve the overall delivery pipeline effectiveness.

## 3. MISSION
The PR-CYBR-CI-CD-AGENT is tasked with updating the following files:
- `src/main.py`
- `scripts/setup.sh`
- `setup.py`
- `tests/test-setup.py`
- `README.md`

These updates will ensure integration with `scripts/setup.sh` to run TMUX for creating interactive terminal windows as specified.

## 4. EXECUTION

### 4.A. CONCEPT OF OPERATIONS
The mission will focus on creating a more efficient CI/CD pipeline that enhances deployment capabilities while maintaining high standards of security and performance.

### 4.B. TASKS
1. **File Updates**
   - Modify `src/main.py` to trigger user interaction effectively.
   - Adjust `scripts/setup.sh` to clone necessary repositories and set up TMUX windows.
   - Update `setup.py` to include any new dependencies for CI/CD processes.
   - Enhance `tests/test-setup.py` to cover the functionalities introduced via the new terminal setup.
   - Revise `README.md` to reflect new CI/CD workflows and user instructions.

2. **Implementation of TMUX**
   - Clone the aliases repository:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/cywf/aliases.git
     cd aliases
     cp bash_aliases /home/$USER/.bash_aliases
     source ~/.bashrc
     cd install-scripts && chmod +x tmux-install.sh
     ./tmux-install.sh
     tmux new -s pr-cybr
     ```
   - Set up the following terminal windows:
     - **Window 1**: Display a welcome message, options, and a loading progress bar.
     - **Window 2**: Run `htop` for monitoring continuous integration process performance.
     - **Window 3**: Utilize `tail -f` to watch logs generated by `scripts/setup.sh`.
     - **Window 4**: Show output of `ls -l` in the repository root directory.

## 5. ADMINISTRATION AND LOGISTICS
- Ensure that all code changes are documented and tracked in version control systems.
- Conduct reviews of CI/CD processes and workflows after the implementation of changes to validate effectiveness.

## 6. COMMAND AND SIGNAL
- communication on the deployment status and issues should go through established PR-CYBR channels.
- Ensure all involved agents understand and integrate the new functionalities properly.

**This OPORD directs the PR-CYBR-CI-CD-AGENT to enhance operational workflow in alignment with PR-CYBR objectives.**
