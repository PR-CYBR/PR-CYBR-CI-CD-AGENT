# OPORD for PR-CYBR-CI-CD-AGENT

## Operation Order (OPORD) - Status Check Implementation

### 1. SITUATION
   - The PR-CYBR initiative aims to enhance agent orchestration by implementing a standardized status check process to verify the operational readiness of all PR-CYBR agents.

### 2. MISSION
   - Integrate the status check functionality into the CI/CD pipeline to ensure timely execution and reporting of agent status.

### 3. EXECUTION
#### a. Concept of Operations
   - The CI/CD pipeline will be configured to automatically initiate status checks at scheduled intervals or upon specific trigger events.

#### b. Instructions
   - Collaborate with the PR-CYBR-MGMT-AGENT to develop and implement the orchestration script for status checks within the CI/CD framework.
   - Ensure the script can send standardized status check requests to all agents and that it captures their responses.
   - Automate the reporting of the status checks to feed directly into the primary dashboard maintained by the PR-CYBR-MGMT-AGENT.

### 4. COORDINATION
   - Work closely with the PR-CYBR-DATA-INTEGRATION-AGENT to ensure seamless integration of status check data into the central repository.
   - Maintain open communication with the PR-CYBR-MGMT-AGENT to address any anomalies or failures reported by the status checks in real-time.

### 5. SERVICE SUPPORT
   - Provide ongoing support and updates in the CI/CD pipeline as needed to enhance functionality and address issues that may arise during the implementation phase.
