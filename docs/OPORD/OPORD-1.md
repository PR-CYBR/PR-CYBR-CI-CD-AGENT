# OPORD for PR-CYBR-CI-CD-AGENT

## Operation Order (OPORD) - Status Check Implementation

### 1. SITUATION
   - The PR-CYBR initiative relies on a robust CI/CD pipeline to maintain operational efficiency. Integrating a standardized status check process into the CI/CD workflows is essential to verify the operational readiness of all agents within the framework and ensure timely alerts and responses.

### 2. MISSION
   - To integrate the status check functionality within the CI/CD pipeline that automatically triggers checks, captures responses, and reports agent statuses for timely operational insights.

### 3. EXECUTION
#### a. Concept of Operations
   - The CI/CD pipeline will be configured to trigger the status check workflows automatically, validating the operational state of each PR-CYBR agent upon defined events or at scheduled intervals.

#### b. Instructions
   - **Integrate the status check workflow**:
     - Embed the status check trigger into existing CI/CD scripts using GitHub Actions. Example workflow files can be reviewed in the respective repositories before integration.
   - **Capture status responses**:
     - Implement code to record status check results received from each agent.
     - Ensure responses are logged in a format that captures timestamps, response content, and any error messages encountered.
   - **Reporting mechanism**:
     - Create a reporting tool that sends the outcomes of the status checks to the PR-CYBR-MGMT-AGENT for aggregation into comprehensive reports.
   - **Feedback loops**:
     - Establish a feedback mechanism within the pipeline to analyze the responses and drive continuous improvement in CI/CD processes.

### 4. COORDINATION
   - Maintain close collaboration with the PR-CYBR-MGMT-AGENT to refine status reporting formats and ensure that notification sequences remain accurate and comprehensive.
   - Collaborate with the PR-CYBR-DATA-INTEGRATION-AGENT to ensure data flow aligns with reporting needs.

### 5. SERVICE SUPPORT
   - Provide ongoing support and updates as needed to enhance CI/CD functionality, addressing issues that arise during status check integration.
   - Create and distribute training materials to educate the team on the new CI/CD processes involving status check capabilities.
