# Logging Guidelines

This directory centralizes CI/CD and automation logs generated by workflows and helper scripts.

## Retention
- **Local development:** keep raw runtime logs for up to 14 days unless they are needed for an ongoing incident investigation.
- **Continuous integration:** retain uploaded workflow artifacts for 30 days, relying on the GitHub retention policy unless a longer retention window is explicitly required.
- **Sanitized summaries:** commit only redacted summaries when they provide long-term value (for example, reproducible CI failure contexts). Replace or delete outdated summaries during routine maintenance.

## Rotation
- Scripts and workflows should timestamp files using the `YYYYMMDDTHHMMSSZ` UTC format to simplify rotation.
- Prefer JSON Lines (`.jsonl`) or JSON (`.json`) so rotation tooling can aggregate easily.
- When files exceed ~5 MB or cover more than one run, rotate them by creating a new timestamped file and archiving or removing the old copy.

## Privacy and Secrets
- Never log environment variables, tokens, passwords, or personally identifiable information.
- Redact repository, container, or host identifiers to the shortest stable suffix needed for troubleshooting.
- Sanitize stack traces and HTTP payloads before committing summaries. If sanitization is not possible, exclude the file from version control entirely.

For more examples, review the README files inside each subdirectory.
